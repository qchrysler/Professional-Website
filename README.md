        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>My name is Quinn Chrysler, and I am currently a junior at Creighton university studying Accounting and Finance with a minor in philosophy. I was born in Seattle, Washington which is a city know for its breathtaking landscapes, and entrepreneurial spirit. My journey was started in the Pacific Northwest, but my journey took various stops such as Tuson, Arizona where I started my early education. Lived here for a short time before settling down at one of my final destinations before college in Minneapolis Minnesota. It was here that I developed who I am as a person today, and built my character up to its current self.
	While I grew up all around, it was in Minnesota that I found one of my special passions that blossomed my creative spirit. What I am referring too is my Hip Hop journey that I spent some of middle school and all of high school chasing. With such a unique activity this greatly open my mind to structured thinking and in depth problem solving, weather that be for a dance routine or a spreadsheet. Additionally I later became a teacher to teach younger kids how to find a passion for dance as I have. This help grow me as a leader, as well as allowed me a different outlet and point of view. Dance greatly shaped my perception of life, and help to grow my mental ingenuity.
	Dance was my first truly challenging activity in my life, but it certainly was not the only experience that I have gained. I would probably say my professional foundation began to form with my summer job of working at Glen Lake Golf course. This was a job that begin developing my patience, adaptability, and ability to connect with others. As I worked both this job as well as being a dance instructor my abilities quickly developed and have become something of a marvel. Additionally I was able to gain amazing experience in customer service with working retail at a GAP in South Carolina for a summer. This not only allowed me to interact with people from the opposite side of the country, but it also helped improve my time management as well as customer service skills.
	As I stated earlier my current course of my life is that of an Accounting Finance major. I feel I was like most college students when I started at Creighton, meaning I had little to no idea where I wanted my life to go. A big part of finding my direction and professional aspirations has to be contributed to my father. He was continuously being promoted and sought after for his increasing skills and resilient work ethic, that is part of why I moved so much in my younger years. He was a perfect role model to shape my work ethic and helped me aim big when it came to picking out a career of being one of the greatest Financial analyst I can be. My goal is to remain a humble hardworking individual who doesn’t have to cross a like to make a living. I plan to take an ethical stance of a honorable hardworking individual. With my morals and virtue something I already consider about my professional aspirations, I know that I will be able to make it to the top of the financial world.
